                    living lab by 2030 while contributing to the quality of life. Creating a roadmap to sustainability \
                    and climate change within education at TU Delft is essential. We are currently working on a better \
                    implementation of both topics in all education programmes. The project initially started with an \
                    inventory of over 1800 BSc, Msc and minor courses on keywords and SDGs. The results were then \
                    gathered in an online (Green) Database that helps both students and teaching staff to have an \
                    overview of sustainability and climate change education at TU Delft and to choose wisely. With \
                    this newly acquired information it was possible to start the discussions with the executive \
                    board and other stakeholders on improving the educational programs. Next to these conversations, \
                    we worked on a university wide framework based on frameworks from literature. A first pilot was \
                    started with the BSc renewal of Building and Architecture started in 2022. During this revision, \
                    all Building and Architecture courses were linked to at least one SDG. The renewed BSc is currently \
                    running for its first year and will soon be evaluated with the help of students and staff. Furthermore, \
                    in January 2025 a community of practice was started in cooperation with The Teaching Lab. From now on, \
                    lecturers, students and support staff interested in sustainability and climate change education will work \

                    of conflict in Africa, particularly between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers. \
                    The IndexBased Livestock Insurance (IBLI) piloted in Kenya provides automated, preemptive \
                    payouts to pastoralists affected by droughts. Combining plausible exogenous variation in \
                    rainfall and the staggered rollout of IBLI in Kenya over the 2001-2020 period, we find \
                    that IBLI strongly reduces drought-induced conflict. Key mechanisms are an income smoothing \
                    effect and reduced migratory pressure for pastoralists, reducing the likelihood of miscoordination \
                    with other land users. Our study suggests that market-based solutions are a scalable, cost-effective\

        "title": "Emerging Food Production for more Sustainable Food Systems",
        "abstract": "Innovations in food systems can support all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The wide scope of the \
                    SDGs calls for holistic approaches that integrate 'siloed' food sustainability assessments in order to develop \
                    solutions able to change complex food systems. Here we present a multi-indicator sustainability assessment to \
                    quantify the performance of food systems, products, and services. Specifically, the integration of nutritional \
                    quality is crucial for a fair assessment. This data shows the need for nutritional equivalent, more sustainable \
                    alternatives to animal-based food and feed. Several aspects regarding affordability of such products need to be \
                    considered and include scalability, need for economy of scale, reduction of capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX). \
                    Centered on this framework, selected solutions by using polyextremophilic microalgae for nutritious food and black soldier fly \
                    larvae (BSFL) for more sustainable feed systems are suggested. The nutrient rich microalgae biomass of Galdieria sulphuraria \
                    grows in low pH (0-3) and at high temperatures up to 56°C without cooling. The selective habitat of G. sulphuraria inhibits \
                    the growth of other microbial species, saving decontamination costs, simplifying the process, enabling circular residue \
                    stream utilization and continuous cultivation. On top of that, our developed emerging nanosecond pulsed electric field \
                    based single cell stimulation enabled up to 40% more biomass production in comparison to the control. All these aspects \
                    significantly minimize CAPEX and OPEX. Integration of up to 50% bright yellow microalgae protein concentrate with significantly \
                    more micronutrients such as vitamin E, B1, B2, B3, and B6 in comparison to soy demonstrated the potential of heterotrophic \
                    microalgae-based meat substitutes. For feed applications, resilient BSFL can effectively convert residue and waste streams \
                    into high quality feed in urban and rural areas. This supports potentially more sustainable feeds for needed livestock in \
                    developing areas. Selected implementation initiatives of these science-driven innovations with relevant industry partners and \
                    start-ups demonstrate the impact and relevance for the food sector."

                    adoption of amine-based technologies and the regeneration of adsorbent materials capable of carrying out this DAC at \
                    moderate energy cost are other complex challenges against the prohibitive energy cost of thermal regeneration techniques. \
                    Within the field, there is interest in capturing CO2 at temperatures closer to those of many industrial exhaust streams. However, \
                    metal oxide sorbents operating at these temperatures generally exhibit slow CO2 uptake kinetics and cycle instability. A final \
                    question remains about the fate of CO2, which has been captured. It is either buried to achieve a negative net cycle or transformed \
                    and valorized in a net zero cycle. During the conference, we will introduce you to the players and technologies in the field, and \
                    discuss their limitations. We will also present our approaches to developing original studies with various metals, cold plasmas, \

                    We'll discuss how, because or thanks to the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in manufacturing assets in Asia, it is now possible to deploy over \
