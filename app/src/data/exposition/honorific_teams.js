                                to finish development and construction of our first pilot plant, which is set out to remove 20 tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere \
                                per year. We reduce the atmospheric levels of CO2 (0.04%) by directly removing it from earth's atmosphere („Direct Air Capture“)  \
                                and storing it as dry ice for long periods of time. This is a necessary step to reach international climate goals of limiting global \
